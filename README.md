# Overview
Documenting everything I do with Orekit/OpenMCT/(more?), starting with the very basics. Documentation can be found in the Wiki.

## Orekit
Orekit is a low-level space dynamics library developed in Java. It is an open-source project first released in 2008 and is used by organizations such as Airbus Defence and Space, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Swedish Space Corporation. The software includes core tools for modeling orbits, attitudes, and related algorithms, serving as a foundational framework for space system development. Its design supports both rapid prototyping with flexible requirements and advanced projects that demand detailed physical modeling, customization, and high precision. Overall, Orekit provides reliable and efficient components for flight dynamics and space mechanics applications.

To begin using Orekit there are some basics that must be addressed as, again, this is a library not an application or software. The [Wiki] go through the basics of building Orekit.

## OpenMCT
Open MCT is an open-source, web-based mission control framework developed by NASA for visualizing and managing space mission data. It lets teams build customizable dashboards using real-time and historical telemetry, timelines, plots, and event trackingl all through a flexible, modular interface. Because it’s browser-based, Open MCT is easy to deploy, integrate with existing systems, and extend with plugins, making it a popular choice for spacecraft operations, research projects, and educational missions.

My experience with OpenMCT is documented in the Wiki.
